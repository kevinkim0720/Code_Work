# Code_Work
Hello. My name is Kevin Kim, and this is my GitHub account. I am trying to learn more coding languages and techniques to polish my skills. Eventually, I would like to have an opportunity to work with software. Most codes in folders Java, SQL, Python, and R were written when I was attending JMU. Any other folders contains projects I have been working on with tutorial help from Tech with Tim youtube. 

Thank You.
